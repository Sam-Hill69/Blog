    <p>Today marks the first day of my programming journey. I have decided from this day forward I have commited to myself that I am going to program everyday. 
        I am going to learn new things about programming and technology to grow my knowledge. This is my first blog post for a website I am learning to create. 
        I create a profile on the odin project and I will dedicate my free time to learning more about computers, continously learning and honning my skills. 
        As you have already noticed this blog is not just about technology but its also about Buisness and Finance. </p>

    <p>It has been 7 days since I have wrote my last entry. Since then a lot has happened with sheala. On tuesday she took her cat to the vet and they gave her bad news.
        Pheobe has congestive heart failure and fluid build up in her lungs so we have been giving her medicine to hopefully get the fluid out, but her last day is nearing.
        Sheala also had eye surgery on her left eye yesturday and hasnt been handling the pain very well. This journal doesnt only contain my accomplishments but also my pitfalls.</p>

    <p>These lessons are starting to get longer but I am actually
            starting to learn things. I learned that in vscode you can 
            just type ! in the first line of a html file or text file 
            and it will just fill in the boilerplate for you </p>

    <p>Today I updated my goals and created a new directory for my webpages. I also learned about 
        a shortcut for comments in html which is hitting ctrl + / for creating comments quickly.

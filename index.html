    <h1>Main Page</h1>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage. My goal is to create a community where people can ask questions and not feel shamed or belittled. 
        This community is for anyone who has a growth mindset and genuienly wants to be a better human being. 
        This is a space online where people can meet local people with the same goals and visions and they can work together to accomplish anything they can dream of. 
        You can achieve anything you put your mind to. Anything you can dream and really want deep down the universe will provide. 
        One of my weaknesses is I struggle to follow through with projects and ideas. I have started countless projects throughout my life. 
        To solve this I have decided to give meself rewards as I complete them, I am going to force myself to see projects through until the end. 
        I need you guys to hold me accountable and I will do the same to each member of this community because I genuily want to see you succeed and live the best life you want and deserve. </p>
